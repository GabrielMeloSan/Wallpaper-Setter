## A wallpaper setter for i3wm new users.

 We will use the package manager "apt" in this code. If you use a different package manager modify and adjust to your needs.

 1. Modify the file path:

    

     cd #/your/file/path

2. Put the name of your file:



      nitrogen --set-zoom-fill #name_of_your_file.png`

*Have fun :)*
